                  According to Wong's ancient texts, the Soul Stone could prove to be the greatest threat out of all the Infinity Stones. Gamora knew of the location of the Soul Stone from a map she found to its whereabouts (which she burnt) but kept this a secret from Thanos.

                    being stored for an unknown amount of time on a pedestal in Kamar-Taj, it was recently wielded by
                    Doctor Stephen Strange, first to aid him in his learning of sorcery, then in his final fight against
                    Kaecilius and Dormammu.</td>

                    which also masked the stone's presence. Stark originally saw the Stone as a power source, whereas
                    once J.A.R.V.I.S. had the opportunity to study the stone he stated it was more akin to a very
                    powerful computer. The stone within had already been in the possession of Thanos when he gave it to
                    Loki to aid him in his invasion of Earth.</td>

                    granting that person immense strength, durability, powers, and subjective influence over the
                    universe. Malekith planned to use the Aether's reality-bending abilities to cover all Nine Realms in
                    darkness; however, he was stopped by the combined efforts of Thor and Jane Foster.</td>

                    entire planet when unleashed. This stone was sought by Thanos, who tasked Ronan the Accuser to
                    acquire it from the dead planet of Morag, in exchange for destroying Xandar.</td>
